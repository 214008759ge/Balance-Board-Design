Balance Board Design by Justin Brown

This was a quick design of a balance board that I created for my 10 and 7 year olds. They love them and our whole family uses them.

Items used:

2'x4' sheet of 3/4" plywood
Shopbot CNC Router at Firstbuild to cut out the pieces
Kreg Jig for pocket screws
8 wood screws for construction
220 grit sandpaper
Vinyl cutter for stickers made at Firstbuild
Laser Cutter at Firstbuild to etch the decorations.
MinWax Polyurethane finish

Have fun while getting some exercise.
